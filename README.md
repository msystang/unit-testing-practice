## Organizing Structure

- Create a Tab Bar Controller.  
- Each Tab in the Tab Bar Controller should be a Navigation Controller
- The Navigation Controller should have a View Controller with a Table View as its Root View Controller
- Selecting a cell in the Table View should segue to a Detail View Controller with additional information.

## Parsing Data

- Below are the endpoints to hit.  For each endpoint, select a search query and copy and paste the JSON into Xcode.  Make a new file called customname.json and save it at the top level of your project.  For each JSON file, create a model that conforms to `Codable`, then build your Table View and associated Detail View Controller.
- <em>Add unit tests for each of the models that you build</em>

# Endpoint One

### [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/ten)

Show a list of all of the setups.  Select a setup to see the punchline.


# Endpoint Two

### [Star Wars API - films](https://swapi.co/api/films/?format=json)

Show a list of all the movies.  Selecting a movie should display the opening crawl.

BONUS: Make the crawl have the same text effect as in the movies.

# Endpoint Three

### [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&encode=url3986)

Display a list of questions.  Selecting a question should bring you to a detailVC where you can see the options.  Selecting the correct answer should make the background turn green and disable selecting any further options.  Selecting an incorrect answer should turn the background red and disable selecting any further options.

Use the `removingPercentEncoding` property on a `String` to make the text readable

BONUS: Track the user's score and don't allow them to answer questions they've already answered.
